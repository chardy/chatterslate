## Install

Run:

Now open `index.html` in your browser, and if you have the LiveReload
plugin installed, it'll automatically refresh for any changes in the examples/
or src/ directories!

## Publishing to NPM

You'll need to be signed in via NPM first!

```sh
npm version patch # or minor or major; commits new version number
yarn release # pushes to github + npm publish
```
