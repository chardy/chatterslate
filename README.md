# ✒️ Chatterslate

SlateJS editor for Chatterbug.

## Install

Run:

```
yarn install
```

Then:

```
yarn start
```

Now open `index.html` in your browser, and if you have the LiveReload
plugin installed, it'll automatically refresh for any changes in the examples/
or src/ directories!

## Publishing to NPM

You'll need to be signed in via NPM first! Then, bump the version number in package.json. After that, just:

```
npm publish
```

Please also make a git tag too: `git tag -a v0.0.0 -m "Releasing 0.0.0"` where `0.0.0` is your version number.
